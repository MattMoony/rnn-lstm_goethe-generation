# RNN (LSTM) - Goethe Generation
_Simple RNN generating Goethe Poems_

## About

This is yet another little test project. I thought of doing this, in order to gain more experience in working with Recurrent Neural Networks (especially with "Long Short Term Memory"-Gates). 

## To-Do

* [x] Dataset preparation
* [x] Simple weight initialization
* [ ] Advanced weight initialization (Xavier initialization, etc.)
* [x] Simple bias initialization
* [x] Activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, softmax)
* [x] Loss-Function (Cross-Entropy)
* [x] Gradient computation function
* [ ] Stochastic Mini Batch Gradient Descent
* [ ] Advanced SGD (Momentum, Adam, etc.)
* [ ] J/Epoch-Graph
* [x] Prediction function
* _... probably more to come ..._
